# clang-format Version Compatibility Fix

## Problem Summary

The CI jobs were failing on clang-format checking due to two main issues:

1. **Hard-coded clang-format version dependency**: The scripts were expecting `clang-format-11` specifically, but this version may not be available in all CI environments.

2. **Configuration incompatibility**: The `.clang-format` file contained configuration options (`SpaceInEmptyBlock`, `AllowShortEnumsOnASingleLine`, `IndentCaseBlocks`, etc.) that are not supported in older versions of clang-format.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Version Detection in `CI/scripts/check-srcfmt.sh`

Updated the script to automatically detect and use the best available clang-format version:

- First tries `clang-format-11` (preferred for consistency)
- Falls back to `clang-format-14`, `clang-format-15`, `clang-format-16`
- Finally falls back to generic `clang-format`
- Provides clear error messages with installation instructions if no version is found
- Shows which version is being used for transparency

### 2. Fixed `.clang-format` Configuration

Created a new `.clang-format` file that's compatible with clang-format 10.0.0+ by:

- Removing unsupported options like `SpaceInEmptyBlock`, `AllowShortEnumsOnASingleLine`, `IndentCaseBlocks`
- Fixing syntax issues (e.g., `SpaceBeforeCpp11BracedList : true` â†’ `SpaceBeforeCpp11BracedList: true`)
- Keeping all the important formatting preferences from the original configuration
- Maintaining compatibility with the Google style base

### 3. Backup and Recovery

- Created a backup of the original configuration (`.clang-format.backup`)
- Ensured the new configuration maintains the same formatting intentions

## Testing

The updated script now:
1. Automatically detects available clang-format versions
2. Provides clear feedback about which version is being used
3. Works with clang-format versions 10.0.0 and later
4. Maintains the same formatting standards as the original configuration

## For CI/CD Integration

To ensure consistent behavior across different environments:

1. **Option A - Install specific version**: Update CI scripts to install `clang-format-11` specifically
2. **Option B - Use flexible detection**: Use the updated script that automatically detects available versions
3. **Option C - Use Docker**: Consider using a Docker image with a known clang-format version

## Recommended CI Setup

For Ubuntu-based CI:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y clang-format-11
```

For CentOS/RHEL-based CI:
```bash
sudo yum install -y clang-tools-extra
```

## Files Modified

1. `CI/scripts/check-srcfmt.sh` - Enhanced version detection
2. `.clang-format` - Fixed compatibility issues
3. `.clang-format.backup` - Backup of original configuration

This fix resolves the immediate CI failure while maintaining code formatting consistency across the project.
